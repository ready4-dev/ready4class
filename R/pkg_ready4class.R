#' Classes For Use As Part of The Ready4 Suite
#'
#' ready4class provides classes and methods that
#' are designed to standardise and streamline the process for extending
#' the readyforwhatsnext data synthesis and simulation framework with new
#' classes.  This development version of the ready4class package has been
#' made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the
#' package. The tools contained in this test release automate a number of
#' tasks which MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.
#' Therefore, you should only trial this software if you feel confident
#' that you understand what it does and have created a sandpit area in
#' which you can safely undertake testing. If you have any questions,
#' please contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
