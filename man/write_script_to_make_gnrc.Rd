\description{
write_script_to_make_gnrc() is a Write function that writes a file to a specified local directory. Specifically, this function implements an algorithm to write script to make generic. The function is called for its side effects and does not return a value. WARNING: This function writes R scripts to your local environment. Make sure to only use if you want this behaviour
