Description: ready4class provides tools to standardise and streamline the
    process for authoring modules for the ready4 youth mental health
    systems model.  This development version of the ready4class package
    has been made available as part of the process of testing and
    documenting the package.  You should only trial this software if you
    feel confident that you understand what it does and have created a
    sandpit area in which you can safely undertake testing. If you have
    any questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
