Description: ready4class provides tools to standardise and streamline the
    process for authoring modules for models developed with the ready4
    framework (https://www.ready4-dev.com/).  This development version of
    the ready4class package has been made available as part of the process
    of testing and documenting the package. You should only trial this
    software if you feel confident that you understand what it does and
    have created a sandpit area in which you can safely undertake testing.
    If you have any questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton1@monash.edu).
