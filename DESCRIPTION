Description: ready4class provides tools to standardise and streamline the
    process for implementing object oriented approaches to developing open
    and modular mental health models.  This development version of the
    ready4class package has been made available as part of the process of
    testing and documenting the package.  You should only trial this
    software if you feel confident that you understand what it does and
    have created a sandpit area in which you can safely undertake testing.
    If you have any questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
