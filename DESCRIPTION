Description: ready4class provides classes and methods that
    are designed to standardise and streamline the process for extending
    the readyforwhatsnext data synthesis and simulation framework with new
    classes.  This development version of the ready4class package has been
    made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the
    package. The tools contained in this test release automate a number of
    tasks which MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.
    Therefore, you should only trial this software if you feel confident
    that you understand what it does and have created a sandpit area in
    which you can safely undertake testing. If you have any questions,
    please contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
