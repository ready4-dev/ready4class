The tools in ready4class are designed to make it easier to consistently author modules for [ready4 - an open source health economic model of the systems shaping mental health and wellbeing in young people](https://www.ready4-dev.com).

This development version of the `ready4class` package has been made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. 

A brief overview of the intended use of `ready4class` is available at:
